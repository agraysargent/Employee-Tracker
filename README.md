# Employee-Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. This assignment required us, to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

# User Story

As a business owner:
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company.
So that I can organize and plan my business.

# Description

A node application built with javascript while also utilizing inquirer and MySQL. This application allows employers to manage and track their employees, in addition to adding and deleting employees, roles, titles, salaries, etc.

# Considerations

As I worked through this assignment, committing work often was essential, in addition to testing your code in node as you progressed through each piece. Another note to keep in mind is correctly installing each package that you will be working with.

# Acceptance Criteria

- Functional application.
- GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.
- The command-line application should allow users to:
- Add departments, roles, employees
- View departments, roles, employees
- Update employee roles
- The command-line application should allow users to:
    - Update employee managers
    - View employees by manager
    - Delete departments, roles, and employees
    - View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
